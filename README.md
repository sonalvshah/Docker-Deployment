# Docker

I created a Docker container to automate text file processing. Using a lightweight base image, I built a containerized Python script to count words, identify frequent terms, handle contractions, and retrieve the machine's IP address. The results were saved to an output file and displayed in the console.  

The Docker image was optimized for size and functionality. For extra credit, I deployed and managed container replicas using Docker Swarm.
